        </header>

        <article class="story-content" id="storyContent">
            <p class="settling">Andy tells Ifti on a Thursday.</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti is leaning over the bills spread across the table, ID lanyard flipping against the wood—two cards, a pen, and a tiny troll keychain bumping together. Andy flinches at the clatter. Why would anyone choose to carry that much weight around their neck? Madness.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I'm getting a dog," Andy says.</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti looks up from the paperwork. "A dog?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Specifically." Andy has a folder. Inside: printouts, notes in careful handwriting, a spreadsheet with columns Ifti can't quite parse. "I've done the research. They're good for flats. Low to moderate exercise requirements. Friendly temperament. I can afford one with Dad's money."</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti's careful: "That's... that's a big thing, mate. The space, the exercising, all the kit and the food. If it's a lot of money then you know you'll have to speak to your Auntie. We should maybe talk through-"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I've talked it through. With myself. For three months. I'm getting a dog."</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">The planning takes two months. Ifti brings worksheets and they talk feeding schedules, vaccination protocols, toilet training methods.</p>

            <p class="settling data">Andy maps the nearest vet, the nearest emergency vet, two backup emergency vets. He calculates monthly costs in a spreadsheet with coloured boxes, coded for one-off or recurring expenditure.</p>

            <p class="settling">Aunty Christine countersigns the forms. "You sure about this, Andrew?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I'm sure."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Your mum would've liked this. You having company."</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy doesn't look up. "Yes."</p>

            <p class="settling beat">At the bank, withdrawing eight hundred pounds, Andy's hands shake. He's only seen this much money on gameshows. The cashier counts it twice. "Big holiday?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"No. A dog," Andy says. "Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Eight weeks old."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Lovely! First one?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Yes. Thankyou, bye."</p>

            <p class="settling breath">Ifti, standing slightly behind, catches the cashier's flicker of confusion, then understanding. She smiles at Andy's back. "Good luck with the pup!" as he strides past Ifti and out through the door.</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">The breeder is in East Kilbride. They take the train. Ifti tries some smalltalk. Andy is quiet, prefers to check through his folder a final three times.</p>

            <p class="settling">The puppy comes in a cardboard box with holes. Ginger and white, small enough to fit in two hands, making soft, lost sounds.</p>

            <p class="settling">The taxi back costs seventeen pounds. Andy holds the box on his lap, rigid.</p>

            <p class="settling">"Wit ye got there?" the driver asks.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"A dog. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Eight weeks old."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Ach, thas braw! First one?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Yes."</p>

            <p class="settling">The driver tries again. "Wit ye callin him?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">Andy is quiet for three seconds. "Archimedes. He's named after the Owl in The Sword in the Stone. He's Merlin's companion but my Dad used to say he's also Arthur's mentor. He's not magic in the story, but he does talk."</p>

            <p class="settling">The driver's eyes find Ifti in the mirror, the lanyard. He nods once. "Listen pal, even in the West End, ye cannae be shoutin' 'Archimedes' in the park".</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">Andy's way ahead of him. "Welllll, actually it's kind of only his formal name anyway. 'Archie' is better for training so it's that that I'd call in the park. If I have to. Some books say if you're shouting after them then you've already lost."</p>

            <p class="settling">"He's got it all worked out." says Ifti after a silence.</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling" data-warmth="start">In the flat, the puppy won't settle. At 11 PM Andy disregards their conversation about boundaries and phones Ifti, who disregards it and answers.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Why won't he lie still?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"It's his first night away from his mum, mate. He's scared."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"The breeder said he'd sleep and I've given him a warm bed with a hot water bottle and a clock to mimic the mother's heartbeat. He's still running around though. I don't know if I've missed something or I read bad information or what, but it's like he's not happy here. I don't want to be tired tomorrow because we have to do toilet training and get used to some different sounds."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Right, okay. Let's take our time. I think… maybe you might need to rethink the plan in the morning. Maybe just try doing different things with him tonight until he settles. You can do this mate, but just remember- you've read all the books on puppies and he hasn't."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"But what if you're wrong? You said you've never had dogs. What if-"</p>

            <p class="settling">"I don't know dogs but I know you. I know sometimes you can struggle with things that come easier to other people, but you never let it get you down and you keep trying. Remember the year after you lost your mum-"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Died. She died, I didn't lose her."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Sorry yeah. But when you didn't think you'd be able to get the bus to Yoker on your own. Remember what I said?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"You said I can do it if I do it my way. Look on street view at the route first, get the timetable, look up the price and make sure I have the right change."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Exactly, and what happened?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I got the bus on my own all the way to Yoker, upstairs at the front by myself."</p>

            <p class="settling">"See! So I was-"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Then I got the first bus back, because it turned out there was nothing in Yoker."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Hah, so I was right on both counts."</p>

            <p class="settling">Silence. Then: "Okay. Well that makes sense. Okay. Thanks, bye."</p>

            <p class="settling beat">At 2 AM they're both asleep. Archie on Andy's chest, Andy's hand curved around him. Both scared. Both okay.</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">Week two is chaos. The flat smells like accidents. Andy has dark circles. Archie has learned nothing.</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti visits, steps over a chewed trainer. "How's it going?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I don't understand. I'm following the guidance." Andy has a printout, highlighted in three colors. "It says puppies can hold their bladder for one hour per month of age. He's nine weeks. He should manage two hours. He doesn't."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Okay, well you always said there'd be-"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Also he won't eat the food I put down so I try something else and then it looks like he likes it, so I get more, but then he stops liking that too."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Right, so it sounds like you might need to-"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"And every time we're out for a wee- him for a wee, me just with him- he either jumps up at somebody and they look annoyed at me and I have to come up with an apology or he drags me over to them and wants to be friendly and I have to come up with something to say or they ask loads of questions."</p>

            <p class="settling internal">"Maybe…" Ifti treads carefully. "Maybe it's going to get better. But also maybe this is it? Would it be okay if this is as good as he gets? Cos if not, we could find him a good home. Someone with a garden, more time…"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"No." Andy is very quiet. "I just need more information."</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling" data-paper="coarse">Week three: Andy has a new spreadsheet.</p>

            <p class="settling data">"Look." He turns the laptop. Columns: Time Fed, Amount Fed, Activity Level, Time Toileted, Location, Success/Failure. Color-coded. Cross-referenced.</p>

            <p class="settling data">"If he eats at 7:42, he usually wants the toilet by 8:17. If he eats at 8:00, he toilets by 8:34. The interval is consistent when you account for activity variables."</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti stares. "That's... actually brilliant."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"It's just consistent. He's a dog. Dogs are really consistent actually."</p>

            <p class="settling beat">Week four: no accidents.</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">March 2020. The news is all virus, lockdown, stay home. Andy wears his mask and gloves, carries spares in his bag. Keeps his distance. Talking through perspex screens doesn't bother him. The city goes quiet. The rules are clear and he follows them.</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti calls through on the laptop: "You doing okay, mate?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Yes. Why?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"Just checking. I know change is hard sometimes. All the new rules and that."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"The rules are fine. They're very specific. Six feet apart. Masks in shops. One household only. It's clear. It's… annoying when some people don't do it properly but Auntie Christine says just focus on what I'm doing."</p>

            <p class="settling">On screen behind Andy: Archie in perfect sit-stay, twelve weeks old, focused on Andy's hand.</p>

            <p class="settling">"Jesus. How'd you teach him that?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Repetition. Consistency. Positive reinforcement. It's not complicated actually."</p>

            <p class="settling">"And it's not getting to you? Lockdown and that?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"It's fine. We're training. See?"</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti pauses. On screen his flat looks small and gloomy. There's washing draped over a radiator. Dishes in the sink. "Just... it's hard for some folk. My girls are with their mum in Paisley. I can see them but the travel's awkward and everything's... anyway. You're managing okay?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"You have kids?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"Aye. Two. Leah and Aisha. Seven and nine." He holds up his lanyard-gonk to camera. "Aisha gave me this, remember?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Oh. Right. Seven and nine. Okay. Welllll… Archie's doing really well with recall now. Do you want to see?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"Aye. Aye, go on then."</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">April. May. June. Ifti calls twice weekly. Andy seems fine. Better than fine. The flat is clean. Archie knows seven commands. Then twelve. Then seventeen.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"He just did the wee-whine," Andy says one call, standing.</p>

            <p class="settling">"The what?"</p>

            <p class="settling data">"The wee-whine. It's different from the hungry-whine and the play-whine. Means he needs toilet. I have them all recorded."</p>

            <p class="settling">"...How many whines does he have?"</p>

            <p class="settling data">"Fourteen distinct vocalizations. Plus twenty-three non-vocal communications. The head-tilt means he doesn't understand the command. The paw-lift means he's uncertain. The ear-twitch means he heard something outside."</p>

            <p class="settling">Silence on the line.</p>

            <p class="settling">"Andy, that's... that's amazing."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"It's just paying attention really. Not amazing."</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti watches Andy drop out of frame- sees his backside in the air, hears grunts and <em>good boys</em>.</p>

            <p class="settling">"Andy? You okay there? What's happening mate?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">Andy bobs back into shot. "Sorry, he does this thing where he rolls on his back and kind of snorts. I thought he looked like he was stimming, so I started getting down and doing it with him."</p>

            <p class="settling">"And?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"He loves it, I think."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Hahaha! Now that is amazing!"</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling" data-warmth="mid" data-paper="dots">August. Restrictions ease slightly and Ifti meets Andy at Kelvingrove Park, first time in five months.</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy looks the same. Archie is bigger now, sleek, moves like water beside Andy's leg. They walk. Archie heels without a command, matches Andy's pace exactly. He only has eyes for Andy.</p>

            <p class="settling">"He's doing brilliant," Ifti says.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Welllll… He's a good dog and we have a routine."</p>

            <p class="settling">They pass the ice cream van. Andy usually avoids it- too many people, too much noise. But Archie pulls slightly toward it, other dogs there, tail waving.</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy stops. "Do you... want ice cream?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"Uh, sure?"</p>

            <p class="settling">They join the queue in socially distanced formation. A woman with a terrier: "Oh, he's gorgeous! How old?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Six months."</p>

            <p class="settling">"He's so well-behaved! Mine's a nightmare."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Training helps. Consistency. Positive reinforcement. Thanks for being nice about my dog, bye."</p>

            <p class="settling breath">The woman smiles, moves to the counter. Andy orders: "Two 99s please. And can dogs have ice cream?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"Aye, I've got pup cups! He's a handsome fella! What's the wee man's name?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Archim... Archie. He's called Archie. And yes, he's handsome, which is statistically likely for a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, who consistently rank in the UK's top five favourite breeds."</p>

            <p class="settling">The vendor blinks. "Aye... Well... I see ya Archie! Here's your pup cup.... Wow, what a good boy! You've trained him well eh!"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I just pay attention really. Thank you for the ice creams and pup cup. Bye."</p>

            <p class="settling">They find a bench. Archie demolishes his pup cup with absolute focus. Andy eats his 99 methodically, cone last.</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti: "That was good chat, mate."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"The ice cream man seemed nice. He probably sells ice cream all day and it's boring in his van so he just wants to chat a bit when people buy stuff. I don't think he needed to know about Archimedes the owl."</p>

            <p class="settling">Ifti doesn't say anything for a moment. They eat their ice creams.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Can I ask you something?" Andy says.</p>

            <p class="settling">"Course."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"When you said your girls are in Paisley. Do you see them much?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"Aye. Well. Twice a week usually. Wednesday night and Saturday. It's... it's good."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"That's good then. Seven and nine, right?"</p>

            <p class="settling">They watch Archie investigate an interesting smell in the grass.</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">March 2021. Phone call: "Ifti, I want to go to Edinburgh."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Oh aye? What for?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Dog show. Scottish Spaniel Society Championship. June fourteenth. I've been preparing."</p>

            <p class="settling">Silence.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Ifti?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"That's... that's brilliant, mate. Really brilliant. You've done amazing with him."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"We've been training for it since before Christmas. I have the routine planned. Twenty-three commands in sequence. Archie knows them all."</p>

            <p class="settling">"I bet he does! It's just... those shows- I don't know. It's intense, right? And busy- lots of people, noise? Judges can be... they might not see what you and Archie have."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"They're judges. That's their job. To see if dogs are trained properly."</p>

            <p class="settling internal">"Yes, but… you don't think maybe they expect a certain kind of person. For things to look… a certain way? I don't want you to be disappointed, especially with all those people watching."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"You said yourself, you don't know dogs, or dog shows. He can do everything they'd want. If there's something you think I need to work on or do differently so he gets to compete…"</p>

            <p class="settling">Another pause. "Aye. No, you're right. I don't know anything about it, but you're great with him. On you go, you'll be brilliant."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Can you come?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"I'll... I'll check my rota. Probably can't get the time off but I'll try."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Okay. The show starts at nine but our category isn't until eleven-thirty so you wouldn't have to leave too early if you can come. It's still limited crowds but I'm allowed two people and Auntie Christine is still poorly."</p>

            <p class="settling">"I'll let you know, aye?"</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">June thirteenth. Text from Ifti: <em>Car trouble, can't make it tomorrow. You'll smash it though. Let me know how it goes.</em></p>

            <p class="settling">Andy reads it twice. Types: <em>Fine.</em></p>

            <p class="settling">Deletes it. Types: <em>Okay. Thanks.</em></p>

            <p class="settling">Sends it.</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling" data-paper="plain">Edinburgh. The hall smells like dog and carpet cleaner.

            <p class="settling">Andy sits in the holding area. Archie beside him in perfect heel position. Andy's hands are in his pockets. His leg is bouncing. He counts his breaths: in for four, hold for four, out for four.</p>

            <p class="settling">A woman next to him: "First time?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Yes."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Nervous?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I'm counting my breaths."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Right. Well. Good luck!"</p>

            <p class="settling">She moves away. Andy keeps counting.</p>

            <p class="settling beat">Their category is called. Novice Handler, Cavalier King Charles. Seven entries.</p>

            <p class="settling">They walk to the ring. The judge is a woman in her sixties, tweed jacket, clipboard. She doesn't smile. "Handler name?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Andrew Dalgleish."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Dog's name?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Archimedes. Called Archie."</p>

            <p class="settling">She writes. "When you're ready."</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy stands at the marker. Archie sits without being told. Andy's breathing is steady now. This is the routine. They've done it two hundred and forty-seven times. It's just data.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Archie. Heel."</p>

            <p class="settling">Archie moves into position. Left side, shoulder aligned with Andy's leg, eyes up.</p>

            <p class="settling">They walk. Andy's gait is his - always has been - and Archie matches it exactly. Not the smooth show-ring pace of the other handlers. Something else. But precise. Synchronized.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Halt."</p>

            <p class="settling">Archie sits immediately.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Down."</p>

            <p class="settling">Archie drops.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Stay."</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy walks ten paces. Turns. Archie doesn't move. Doesn't look away.</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Come."</p>

            <p class="settling">Archie comes. Fast, focused, sits in front of Andy without command.</p>

            <p class="settling">They go through the sequence. Twenty-three commands. Every transition clean. Andy's hand signals are small, precise. Archie's responses instant. Between commands, Archie checks Andy's face. Andy's shoulders drop fractionally when Archie gets it right.</p>

            <p class="settling">The judge watches. Writes.</p>

            <p class="settling">Other handlers move smooth, practiced, performing. Andy is Andy. The partnership is visible but it looks different. The timing is odd. The spacing unusual. Andy doesn't present the dog, doesn't engage with the audience. He just works through the sequence like he's alone in his flat.</p>

            <p class="settling">When they finish, the judge says: "Thank you."</p>

            <p class="settling beat">Andy walks back to the holding area. His heart is loud in his chest. The routine was perfect. He has the data. Every cue landed. Every transition executed exactly as practiced.</p>

            <p class="settling">They wait while the other entries compete. Andy counts the commands each handler uses. Measures the approximate timing. Archie sits beside him, calm.</p>

            <p class="settling">The judge calls them back for placement.</p>

            <p class="settling">Seventh place goes to a young spaniel, barely trained. Sixth goes to Andy and Archie. Fifth through to first go to handlers who moved right, presented well, whose dogs were good but not-</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy looks at the white ribbon in his hand. Participation. Thank you for entering.</p>

            <p class="settling">The winner gets a trophy, a rosette, applause.</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy leaves during the photographs.</p>

            <p class="section-break">· · ·</p>

            <p class="settling">On the train home, Andy watches the routine on his phone. The video is clear. Every command visible. Every response correct. He plays it three times.</p>

            <p class="settling">Archie sleeps on the seat beside him, head on Andy's leg.</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy opens his spreadsheet. Updates it:</p>

            <p class="settling data"><em>Edinburgh Show June 14th 2021. Commands executed: 23/23. Placement: 6th of 7. Notes: Routine completed as practiced. Judge: Mrs. F. Henderson. Will review video for errors.</em></p>

            <p class="settling">He watches the video again. Can't find any.</p>

            <p class="settling">Saves the spreadsheet. Puts his phone away. Looks out the window at Scotland going past in the dark.</p>

            <p class="settling">His hand rests on Archie's head.</p>

            <p class="settling">That evening, Ifti calls.</p>

            <p class="settling">"How'd it go?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"We came sixth."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Ah, mate. I'm sorry."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Why? We did the routine perfectly. Every cue, every transition. I have it on video. Do you want to see?"</p>

            <p class="settling">Pause. "Aye. Aye, send it over."</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy sends the video. Waits. The call sits quiet. Three minutes pass. Four.</p>

            <p class="settling" data-warmth="full">When Ifti's face appears on screen again, his eyes are red.</p>

            <p class="settling">"That was perfect, Andy."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I know. That's what I said. I can't find the errors."</p>

            <p class="settling">"There weren't any."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Then why did we come sixth?"</p>

            <p class="settling internal">Ifti is quiet for a long moment. "I don't know, mate. I don't know."</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy looks at the screen. At Ifti's face. "Your car's fixed then?"</p>

            <p class="settling">"What?"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"You said it was broken. But you're okay now?"</p>

            <p class="settling">Another pause. "Aye. It's... aye, it's fixed."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"That's good."</p>

            <p class="settling">"Andy-"</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"I'm going to enter the Autumn championship. In Falkirk. November twenty-first. If you can't come to that one either it's okay though."</p>

            <p class="settling">"I'll be there," Ifti says quickly. "I'll be there, I promise."</p>

            <p class="settling dialogue">"Okay. I'm going to practice more. I made a list of things the winning trainers do that I didn't do. I'll do them and see."</p>

            <p class="settling beat">After they hang up, Andy makes tea. Feeds Archie. They do the evening walk. Training from eight to eight-thirty, same routine, same commands, Archie perfect every time.</p>

            <p class="settling">At ten PM Andy updates the spreadsheet one more time:</p>

            <p class="settling data"><em>Falkirk Show: November 21st. Research judges. Review successful entries. Increase practice frequency.</em></p>

            <p class="settling final">Archie is already asleep on the couch, allowed now, rules relaxed over time.</p>

            <p class="settling">Andy watches him for a moment. Twitching in dreams. Probably chasing something.</p>

            <p class="settling">He closes the laptop.</p>

            <p class="settling final-last">Tomorrow: practice.</p>
