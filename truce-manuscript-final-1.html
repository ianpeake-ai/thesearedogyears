            </header>

            <article class="story-content">

                <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he hall tonight is the world entire.</p>

                <p>Outside it is dark enough to lose one's way between the gate and the door, cold enough in the blizzard to kill you while you find the way back. A wind keens through the forest, finding gaps in wool, gaps in stone. This winter night makes men check the thatch, count cords of firewood and pray - to Christ or the old gods or both - that enough was stored to see spring. Groans and curses chorus from within as the door opens, a hound lopes out, circles sniffing the ground. A man feels his way along the wall and squats, adding to the snowy dung pile as the dog steams his own patch of snow. This night, a man could freeze trying to make it to the midden. He finishes with a piss, sways back to the door and shoulders himself and the dog in toward the roar of flame and drunken voices.</p>

                <!-- MARGINALIA: Man pissing against wall -->
                <div class="marginalia left marginalia-pissing">
                    <img src="marginalia-pissing.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>Inside are heat, bodies, smoke. A boar, dripping monstrous on the spit, turns to silken fat on the tongue, dripping down beards. Mead is thick and sweet, honey-dark in wooden bowls. The great hearth throws shadows up to the rafters where smoke hangs like river fog.</p>

                <p class="breath">A tumult: a filthy rhyme, a fight about last year's hunt, a woman sings off-key but sincere, the harp player tries to tune over the noise, gives up, starts a drinking song instead.</p>

                <p>The smell is of the meat-char and the tallow candles and the pine resin rubbed into the beams. There is wet wool drying too close to flame and there is the sweat of dogs and humans, and there is something sharper underneath - the smell of bodies warm and close and drunk and alive.</p>

                <p class="breath">The feasting and the drinking are assured, but there is a muddle over the name of the thing. The eve before the mass of the holy infant, though most would still say Midwinter as their grandparents did. Or Yule, or the fire festival. Naming aside, the impulse is old and certain: it is the night to eat and drink and dance and warm cold hands with flesh, because tomorrow's promises can't be trusted. The dark and the ice claim too many victories and not everyone will see the spring, so to themselves, to whatever watches from the winter, those in the hall say <em>we are here, now, these hearts beat yet</em>.</p>

                <p>At the high table, the thegn pours mead for his brother's ghost. A hard death - a long fever after the boar's tusk. The thegn raises his cup to the empty place at the bench, makes no speech. Tonight is for the living.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>The dogs sprawl full-bellied at the hearth. Bones cracked for marrow. Scraps of pork skin, crisp and salt-sharp. The day brought good hunting and better eating and this night has loosened the usually complex humans into simpler creatures of tongue and touch. Most of the dogs are young, active even in rest, ears swiveling at every sound - the door, the rafters, each other.</p>

                <p class="breath">This one is older. Greying muzzle and scars telling tales across his face: boar tusk, wolf tooth, work done, violence survived. To work is to hunt, to hunt is to kill, to kill is to eat and to earn the touch of the men at the high table.</p>

                <p>He watches more than sleeps. Veteran. Knows the rhythms: hall and hunt, feast and famine, when to chase and when to wait.</p>

                <p class="breath">Tonight is waiting. Inside the hall is life, outside is death. Blood shed here and now will bring no table scraps or ear scratches, so he watches, sighs.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>A year ago the thegn was less sure than many if he would see tonight's feast. To rule is to choose in public and this year's choices were narrow: a harvest thin in places, the fever stalking the valleys, the stores pitched against the unforgiving seasons. But he sits expansive in his glow of firelight, gold, and golden mead. The hall is full, the fire high, his people fed.</p>

                <p>The old monk sits beside him, eating with the precise appreciation of a man who understands exactly how much labor went into getting meat to table. This is Bede of Jarrow, though most here know him as Father. He has a quiet, shrewd face and hands that have held quill more often than sword, but the hall grants space and stillness around him. He is here to see beyond the monastery walls as he prepares to release his opus into the world, but also to be seen, as per the wishes of the Abbot.</p>

                <p class="breath">He has with him a younger man of his order. His earnest eyes and his melodic voice will do well to carry the Word. Bede noticed this, mentioned to the Abbot, and here they are. The young man's nervous fingers drum the table - he has prepared for weeks to give this, his first real sermon to an audience outside their cloistered world.</p>

                <p>After the meal, before the drinking gets too serious, the test will be: can the doe eyes and the flute-voice help the boy land theology with this congregation who smell like their dogs and think with their bellies.</p>

                <p class="breath">Across the hall, in the shadows between benches: a man's hand is on a woman's thigh under the fur draped across their laps. Her laugh, low and promising. His whisper in her ear. Her hand covering his, pressing it higher. They're not subtle. No one cares. This is the kind of feast where bodies remember they're alive.</p>

                <!-- MARGINALIA: Couple canoodling -->
                <div class="marginalia right marginalia-couple">
                    <img src="marginalia-couple.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>The meal ends slowly. Scraps thrown to the dogs. Bowls refilled. A child runs past with a piece of gristle, chased by another child, both shrieking.</p>

                <p>Those who have been holding on finally break - pushing up from benches, groaning, making for the door. Every opening lets in a blast of winter that sucks the warmth from the hall; every closing slams heat back into place. The door becomes a kind of bellows: cold in, warmth out, cold in, warmth out - until the flames rear like startled horses.</p>

                <p>Shouts of protest. Laughter. Someone, with ludicrous seriousness, organises a convoy: a dozen men and women fit to burst, dogs at heel, all crowded by the door. On the count of three they rush out as one, vanish into the storm, and the hall slams shut behind them. A single scream of cold from outside; a roar of laughter inside.</p>

                <p class="breath">The thegn raises his hand. Children are shushed. The last few talkers feel elbows in their ribs. Silence falls. Mostly.</p>

                <p>"Father," he says, nodding to his venerable guest. His voice is rough with smoke and shouting. "Would you share wisdom with us?"</p>

                <p>It is theatre, of course. Settled in letters weeks ago. Bede is respected, yes - but the true guests are Jarrow's long shadow, the abbot, his reach, and the grey-sleeved hands that hold the future. <span class="latin">Scientia est potentia.</span> Knowledge is power; this is how it moves.</p>

                <p>Old Bede bows his head slightly, the gesture of a man who knows the weight of being useful. Smiling, he touches his student's shoulder.</p>

                <p class="breath">"My brother here will speak," he says. "Listen well."</p>

                <p>The young monk stands. Swallows. Looks around the hall at all the faces - flushed, drunk, skeptical, curious, bored, horny, distracted, alive in ways the monastery never is.</p>

                <p>For a brief moment he thinks, <em>I know nothing of the world</em>, until the slightest cough from his mentor pushes him forward.</p>

                <p>He begins. The voice is clear.</p>

                <p>"<span class="latin">Fratres et sorores</span>," he says. Latin first, as trained. "Brothers and sisters. On this holy night, I ask you - <span class="latin">quaeso</span> - to imagine -"</p>

                <p>Someone groans immediately. The Latin? Already he's losing them. Eyes glaze. Someone refills their bowl.</p>

                <p>He pivots to English, faster.</p>

                <p>"Imagine a sparrow…"</p>

                <p class="breath">He pauses. He's been told pauses create weight.</p>

                <p>"What kind of sparrow?"</p>

                <p>A thane, older, grinning. Not hostile. Just drunk and literal.</p>

                <p>The monk falters. "I don't - it doesn't -"</p>

                <p>The thane leans forward, earnest, helpful:</p>

                <p>"House sparrow? Tree sparrow? They're different birds entirely."</p>

                <p>"Male or female?" a woman asks, genuinely curious.</p>

                <p>"It is a solitary sparrow, of any sex or type…" the young monk says, suddenly very hot.</p>

                <p>"Solitary? Where's its mate?" another woman demands. "Poor thing. Did it die?"</p>

                <p>He pushes on. "The sparrow flies from the cold and dark of the winter storm -"</p>

                <p>"Why's it flying at night?" someone calls, authoritative. "Sparrows roost. They nest in the thatch. Shit everywhere."</p>

                <p>"No, that's pigeons -"</p>

                <p>"What's important about the sparrow," the monk insists, voice rising into shrillness, "is that it's alone, flying from the cold - not necessarily dark - storm - and -"</p>

                <p>"Maybe simple Tom ate its mate!" someone shouts. Laughter detonates. The monk's face burns.</p>

                <p>"Tom bites the heads off sparrows and any other birds he catches," the thegn murmurs to Bede behind the young monk's back. "Has done since he was small, if that's important."</p>

                <p class="breath">In the corner, Tom grins with the attention.</p>

                <!-- MARGINALIA: Tom with sparrow -->

                </div>

                <p>"The SPARROW," the monk practically shouts, "<span class="latin">vola</span> - FLIES - into the hall -"</p>

                <p>"Which door?" the first thane again, still earnestly trying to help. "North door's stuck. Been meaning to fix it since harvest."</p>

                <p class="breath">The hall becomes chaos. Everyone talks at once about sparrows, doors, Tom's eating habits, whether pigeons shit more than sparrows. Someone's child demands to see a sparrow RIGHT NOW. A man drops his bowl with a crash; cursing follows; laughter erupts and feeds on itself.</p>

                <p>The young monk drowns in the noise, his careful sermon collapsing into drunk ornithology.</p>

                <p><span class="latin">Vita brevis est</span>, he thinks. <em>And I'll soon be dead, what a happy thought.</em></p>

                <p class="breath">The abbot watches, his face still - interested even - as his eyes range over the crowd, the thegn, back to his young brother.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>And while theology drowns in laughter, while the monk flounders and the people argue about sparrows, something else enters the hall.</p>

                <p>Low and fast - a brown streak along the wall where shadow meets floor. The weasel lives in the walls, hunts the mice that hunt the grain. It can't be trained, can't be called, can't be anything but what it is: murder in fur, perfect and efficient and swift death to pests.</p>

                <!-- MARGINALIA: Weasel -->

                </div>

                <p class="breath">It slips through a gap where timber meets stone with something in its jaws. A rabbit, still moving. A late season kit, barely grown.</p>

                <p>The weasel drops it on the rushes. The rabbit tries to scramble away, one hind leg dragging. Blood on its neck. The weasel pounces - not yet to kill, but to play. It bites, releases. Bats it with a paw. Pounces again. The kit breathes hard.</p>

                <p>No one sees. Eyes are on the blushing monk or their mead or someone's round arse or nothing at all, vision blurred drunk-soft and firelit. No one but the old dog.</p>

                <p class="beat">The grey muzzle lifts.</p>

                <p class="close">Nose reads the air.</p>

                <p class="breath"><em>Blood. Fear. Prey.</em></p>

                <p>The hound has no word for it, but the scent of it is, to him, elemental: <em>rabbit</em>.</p>

                <p>His eyes scan the dark places and find the shapes of the weasel and its quarry. He is no philosopher, but he is old and has given death in his turn, and something in him recognises this instinct expressing itself past necessity into joy. Surplus killing. The hunt extended into sport. Something in him sees the truth of it: this must be.</p>

                <p class="breath">The weasel bats the kit again, lazy and confident. The rabbit drags itself a few inches through the rushes. It can't run. There is nowhere safe to hide. It bleeds, shakes, lives, for now.</p>

                <p>Then - someone drops something. There's a loud crash, a shout, and the weasel is gone - vanished back into the walls like smoke.</p>

                <p>The rabbit doesn't move. There are puncture wounds on its neck and side, its fur matted with blood and saliva. It is exhausted. It is dying, probably. It is trapped inside with giants and dogs and boots and death everywhere and nowhere to go. It knows this and remains still.</p>

                <p class="breath">A thin sound, almost inaudible under the noise: the rabbit's breath is fast and shallow. It whimpers without voice.</p>

                <p class="beat">The old dog's body goes tense.</p>

                <p><em>Prey.</em></p>

                <p class="breath">Right there.</p>

                <p>Easy prey. Wounded prey. No chase needed. He could cross the hall, snap once, it would be done.</p>

                <p>Every instinct he's ever had, everything he was bred for, trained for, praised for over seven years of hunting -</p>

                <p class="breath"><em>Kill it.</em></p>

                <p>The kit tries to hide, dragging itself behind a table leg, but there's no cover. Only rushes and boots and benches and people's feet that could step on it without noticing.</p>

                <p class="breath">It stops moving. Too tired. Too hurt. Just: waiting for whatever comes.</p>

                <p>The dog watches. Every kill has a single right moment and a dozen wrong ones.</p>

                <p>At the front of the hall, the young monk has stopped trying to be heard. His cheeks and now his neck flush scarlet. The thegn frowns. The crowd debates: did Tom's mum make him eat the sparrows he caught as a child, or did he sneak them behind the midden, a guilty snack. Someone's child is crying because they think all the sparrows might have been eaten, and the harp player has started playing again, though nobody asked him to.</p>

                <p class="breath">The abbot catches the monk's eye.</p>

                <p class="close">Doesn't speak.</p>

                <p class="close">Just: small gesture. Subtle. Old hand, patient.</p>

                <p class="breath"><em>Slow down. Look around. Use the room.</em></p>

                <p class="close">The monk sees it.</p>

                <p class="close">Understands, maybe.</p>

                <p class="breath">Takes a breath. Long one. Lets it out.</p>

                <p>Lets the chaos continue a moment longer. Doesn't fight it. Just: stands there, present, waiting.</p>

                <p>Then - loud, but not shouting:</p>

                <p class="beat">"Look around you."</p>

                <p>Something in his voice. Different. Not the trained sermon-voice. Something rawer.</p>

                <p>People pause. Not silence, but: less noise. Curious.</p>

                <p>"No sparrows here," he says. Looks around at actual faces. "Just us."</p>

                <p class="breath">Waits. Let them look too.</p>

                <p>"This hall. Right now. <span class="latin">Hic et nunc.</span>"</p>

                <p>Gestures at the space. The fire. The people. The mess.</p>

                <p>"Outside?"</p>

                <p>Points at the door.</p>

                <p>"<span class="latin">Frigus.</span> Cold enough to kill. You know this - you walked through it. Felt it looking for the gaps in your coat."</p>

                <p class="breath">They're listening now. Because: true. Bone-true. They remember the walk here, the wind.</p>

                <p>"Inside?"</p>

                <p>Gestures at the hearth, the fire throwing gold across faces.</p>

                <p>"This fire. This food. Each other. <span class="latin">Lux et vita.</span>"</p>

                <p class="breath">Simple now. Things they can see. Touch. Taste.</p>

                <p>"How long does it last?"</p>

                <p>Pause. Real silence now. Let them think.</p>

                <p>"Tonight. Maybe tomorrow if we're lucky. Then back out into the cold. Then the fire dies. Then we die. All of us. Every single one."</p>

                <p class="breath">The room: completely still. Even the children quiet.</p>

                <p>"So while we're here -" He looks around. Sees them seeing him. "- while the fire burns - while there's warmth and food and each other -"</p>

                <p class="breath">Beat.</p>

                <p class="beat">"This hall is sanctuary."</p>

                <p>The words land. Heavy. Real. Present.</p>

                <p class="breath">Not metaphor. Not theology. Just: truth spoken into the room it describes.</p>

                <p>"The darkness doesn't care about us. Winter doesn't care. The forest doesn't care. But in here - for now - we care for each other."</p>

                <p class="breath">Another beat.</p>

                <p>"That's all we've got."</p>

                <p class="close">Pause.</p>

                <p class="breath">"That's everything."</p>

                <p class="breath">Silence.</p>

                <p>Long silence.</p>

                <p class="breath">Then: applause. Genuine this time, not polite. Rough hands hitting tables. The thegn nodding, moved despite himself, blinking something away. Old warriors suddenly interested in their bowls. The woman who asked about the sparrow's mate wiping her eyes.</p>

                <p>The young monk sits, breathing hard. Shaking slightly. The abbot's hand on his shoulder, brief pressure.</p>

                <p class="breath"><em>Good. You learned.</em></p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p class="breath">The rabbit has made a choice.</p>

                <p>Not thought. Not reasoning. Just: animal logic. Everything here is threat. Boots, voices, light, movement, dogs everywhere. But one thing hasn't moved. One warm shape, still and calm in all this chaos.</p>

                <p class="breath">The old dog.</p>

                <p>The rabbit drags itself toward him. Slow. Painful. Leaving a thin trail of blood on the rushes.</p>

                <p class="beat">The dog sees it coming.</p>

                <p class="close">Could move. Could turn. Could snap.</p>

                <p class="breath">Should.</p>

                <p>Prey approaching predator. Natural order inverted. Suicide.</p>

                <p class="beat">But.</p>

                <p class="breath"><em>The hall is sanctuary.</em></p>

                <p>The monk just said so. Named it. Made it real in the room.</p>

                <p>Not for rabbits - he meant people, souls, salvation. But he said it. The words are in the air now.</p>

                <p class="breath"><em>Sanctuary.</em></p>

                <p>And the dog has lived long enough to know: when the hall is warm and bellies are full and the chaos is the good kind - this isn't hunting time. This is the other thing. The rest. The truce.</p>

                <p class="breath">Outside: he hunts. Tomorrow: he'll hunt again. But inside, tonight -</p>

                <p class="beat">The rabbit reaches his flank.</p>

                <p class="breath">So it presses against warm fur.</p>

                <p>Tiny heart hammering against his ribs, impossibly fast. Breath shallow, panicked, wet. Blood soaking warm into his coat - copper-smell, prey-smell, the scent that means food to everything he is.</p>

                <p class="breath">His jaw muscles tense. Reflex. The urge to turn his head, open his mouth, close it on fragile neck bones.</p>

                <p>The feast continues above him.</p>

                <p>Someone starts singing. Off-key, drunk, happy. Others join in, making it worse and better simultaneously. The children run past again, close enough that one almost steps on the rabbit, doesn't see it, keeps running. Someone shouts something funny. Laughter. A bench scrapes. More mead poured.</p>

                <p class="breath">The man and woman from earlier slip out into the night, trying for subtle, failing, nobody pretending not to notice anymore. Someone makes a joke. More laughter.</p>

                <p>The fire burns down. Someone adds wood. It flares bright - the dog's eyes catch the light, reflect gold - then settles to steady burn again.</p>

                <p class="beat">The rabbit's trembling: constant. Violent. Its whole small body shaking against the dog's side.</p>

                <p>The dog stays tense. Can't relax. Won't. The scent is overwhelming. Every breath fills his nose and mouth with prey. His whole body wants to move. Teeth ache with it. Jaw muscles twitch.</p>

                <p class="breath">Outside, the wind picks up. Howls against the walls. The hall answers with warmth, with voices, with fire-crackle and human sounds.</p>

                <p>The singing continues. Different song now. Older. Something about summer, about green things, about not-winter. Defiance sung at the dark.</p>

                <p>Hours.</p>

                <p>The drinking gets quieter. Not stopping - just running out of energy. People settling into corners. Some passing out at tables, heads on arms. Others stumbling to wherever they sleep. Children carried, already unconscious. The fire tended and banked and built again.</p>

                <p class="breath">The dog: still awake. Still tense. Still holding.</p>

                <p>The scent hasn't faded. Still there. Still prey. Still food. His stomach knows it even if his mind doesn't. Instinct doesn't sleep.</p>

                <p class="breath">More time.</p>

                <p>The rabbit's trembling slows. Not stopped - just: less violent. Exhaustion winning over terror. Warmth seeping in. The dog's body-heat radiating, the rabbit soaking it in like sun.</p>

                <p class="breath">Still bleeding, probably. Still dying, probably. But not right now. Right now: warm. Safe as anything wounded has ever been.</p>

                <p>The hall settles. Quieter now. Fire low but steady. People sleeping in piles of fur and limbs. A few still awake, drinking quiet, murmuring low. The thegn and his abbot, talking about something - land, tithes, politics. Doesn't matter.</p>

                <p class="breath">The dog watches the fire. Watches the shadows. Feels the rabbit breathe against his ribs.</p>

                <p>This is the longest night. Solstice. The dark winning, the light fighting back, everything balanced on the edge between.</p>

                <p class="breath">The dog holds the edge.</p>

                <p>Midnight passes. He doesn't know what midnight is but he feels it - something shifts. The wind changes. The cold presses different. The turn toward morning, still hours away but coming.</p>

                <p class="breath">The rabbit, against his side: breathing steadier now. Not healed. Not saved. Just: alive for longer than it was supposed to be.</p>

                <p>Has to. Can't trust himself to sleep. The instinct is too strong. If he sleeps, his body might move without him, might do what bodies do, might end this before -</p>

                <p class="breath">Before what?</p>

                <p class="breath">He doesn't know. Just knows: not yet.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>More hours.</p>

                <p>At some point - past midnight, before dawn, in that deepest dark - the abbot stands. Stiff. Old bones protesting. Needs to piss or find a corner to sleep or both.</p>

                <p class="breath">He passes the dogs.</p>

                <p class="close">Pauses.</p>

                <p class="breath">Sees the old one awake. Alert. Unusual.</p>

                <p>Doesn't see the rabbit, hidden in shadow and fur and the dog's careful stillness.</p>

                <p>He reaches down. Hand on the dog's head. Brief. Warm.</p>

                <p class="breath">"<span class="latin">Fidelis</span>," he murmurs. Latin. Faithful. "Keeping watch, old boy."</p>

                <p class="breath">Doesn't know what he's praising.</p>

                <p class="breath">Moves on.</p>

                <p>The dog doesn't acknowledge it. Can't. Still holding the truce. Still feeling prey breathe. Still resisting everything he is.</p>

                <p class="breath">The abbot finds his corner. Settles. Sleeps.</p>

                <p>The hall: dark now except for fire-glow. Quiet except for breathing, snoring, the wind outside, the fire's whisper.</p>

                <p class="close">The dog: awake.</p>

                <p class="close">The rabbit: asleep.</p>

                <p class="breath">The longest night, held in balance.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>Hours more.</p>

                <p>The dog's body aches. Tension held too long. Jaw sore from clenching. Neck stiff. But he doesn't move. Can't. If he moves, it ends.</p>

                <p class="breath">The fire burns lower. Someone should tend it but everyone's sleeping. It'll last till dawn. Probably.</p>

                <p class="beat">Grey light starts to show through gaps in the walls. Thin at first. Barely there. Then: definite. Dawn.</p>

                <p class="beat">The rabbit wakes.</p>

                <p class="close">Lifts its head.</p>

                <p class="breath">Sees light. Sees the dog's face, still there, still watching.</p>

                <p class="beat">A moment.</p>

                <p class="close">Eye contact.</p>

                <p class="breath">Not understanding - animals don't do that. Just: acknowledgment.</p>

                <p class="breath"><em>You didn't kill me.</em></p>

                <p>The rabbit drags itself away. Still limping. Still bleeding. But alive. Moving.</p>

                <p class="breath">Finds the gap where the weasel went. Squeezes through. Stone scraping fur. Gone.</p>

                <p class="beat">The dog watches it go.</p>

                <p class="close">Doesn't follow.</p>

                <p class="breath">Doesn't alert the others.</p>

                <p class="breath">Just: watches until it's gone.</p>

                <p>Then - finally - moves. Stands. Shakes. Every muscle protesting. Stretches. Yawns, jaw cracking.</p>

                <p class="close">The truce: over.</p>

                <p class="breath">The world: resuming.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>The hall wakes slowly.</p>

                <p>Groaning. Cold. Hungover. Someone gets up to tend the fire, cursing the cold, adding wood with unnecessary noise. Others stirring. Children waking hungry. Servants moving, heating water, starting the work of the day.</p>

                <p class="breath">The thegn rises, stretches. Looks around at his hall, his people. Survived another night. Made it to morning.</p>

                <p>"Good hunting weather," he says to no one in particular. Then louder: "Lads! Get the dogs. Let's work off last night."</p>

                <p>Boxing Day. Tradition. Stretch the legs. Clear the head. Bring home meat for the week.</p>

                <p class="breath">The dogs hear "hunting" and transform. Tails up. Ears forward. Alert. Even the old dog, stiff from the cold floor and the long vigil, rises.</p>

                <p class="close">Ready.</p>

                <p class="breath">This is the work.</p>

                <p>Outside: fresh snow in the night. The world clean and white and cold. Tracks everywhere - deer, boar, fox. Maybe rabbit.</p>

                <p class="breath">The hounds cast about, noses down. The old dog finds a trail. Strong. Recent. Deer. He bays once - <em>here</em> - and the pack converges.</p>

                <p>The thegn and his men follow. Spears. Bows. Breath steaming. The chase warming them, waking them, burning off feast and mead.</p>

                <p class="beat">The old dog runs.</p>

                <p>Fast still, despite age. Powerful. Knows this work in his bones. This is what he is. This is what he's for.</p>

                <p class="breath">The deer breaks from cover. The dogs pursue. Voices rising - the hounds baying, alive with purpose, doing exactly what they were made to do.</p>

                <!-- MARGINALIA: The hunt -->
                <div class="marginalia left marginalia-hunt">
                    <img src="marginalia-hunt.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>The old dog is first to close. He's always first. Knows exactly where to grab - the haunch, hard - holds, brings it down. The pack swarms. Controlled chaos. The thegn arrives, blade out, quick kill.</p>

                <p class="close">Blood on snow.</p>

                <p class="close">Steam rising.</p>

                <p class="breath">The thegn's hand on the old dog's head. Rough affection.</p>

                <p class="breath">"Good boy. Well done."</p>

                <p class="breath">The dog's tail wags once.</p>

                <p class="close">This is right.</p>

                <p class="close">This is order.</p>

                <p class="breath">This is the partnership.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>They drag the deer back. The dogs get their share - blood-warm meat, organs, praise. Valued. Essential. Good work rewarded.</p>

                <p class="breath">The old dog settles in his spot by the hearth.</p>

                <p class="close">Same place he held the vigil.</p>

                <p class="breath">No trace of the rabbit now. No blood on the rushes - someone swept them clean at dawn. No evidence.</p>

                <p class="breath">Just: him, and the memory of warmth against his side, and the choice he made in the dark.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>The abbot and his monks leave after breaking fast. Thanks exchanged. Blessings. Promises of support. The thegn generous with food for their journey - good politics, good faith, both.</p>

                <p class="breath">The young monk walks different now. Straighter. Something in him changed. Tested and not found wanting. He learned last night, though he couldn't say exactly what.</p>

                <p>The abbot will return to Jarrow. Will sit at his desk in the monastery, high window looking east. Will pick up his quill. He's writing a history - the English people, their conversion, their kings and saints and slow transformation from old gods to new.</p>

                <p class="breath">He'll write about a hall. A feast. A counselor speaking to a king about life's brevity. He'll put the sparrow there, in that counselor's mouth, at that legendary moment a hundred years before.</p>

                <p class="close">He'll make it clean. Perfect. Eloquent.</p>

                <p class="close">He'll leave out the drunk hecklers and the desperate pivot and his student's face when the sermon collapsed.</p>

                <p class="breath">He'll leave out the weasel and the rabbit and the dog.</p>

                <p class="breath">Those weren't important to the history he's writing.</p>

                <p class="breath">But they happened.</p>

                <p class="section-break">✦ ✦ ✦</p>

                <p>Outside, snow keeps falling.</p>

                <p class="breath">Inside, the fire burns.</p>

                <p class="breath">The dog sleeps.</p>

                <p class="close">Tomorrow: hunt resumes.</p>

                <p class="breath">Tonight: rest.</p>

                <p>The world unchanged. Winter still winter. The hunt still the hunt. Prey still prey. Dogs still dogs.</p>

                <p class="beat">But.</p>

                <p class="close">For those hours.</p>

                <p class="close">One old dog.</p>

                <p class="close">One wounded rabbit.</p>

                <p class="breath">One choice held through the longest dark.</p>

                <p class="beat">The hall was sanctuary.</p>

                <p class="close">The monk named it.</p>

                <p class="breath">The dog kept it.</p>

                <p class="close">Brief warmth.</p>

                <p class="close">Temporary truce.</p>

                <p class="breath">Grace.</p>
